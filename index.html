	<!-- About -->
	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> My name is Janay Peters and I currently live in Atlanta,Ga. I was born in Mobile,Al and have lived in Georgia for 8 years now.
	I love to play tennis and dance; I've had a love for technology my whole life, but didn't know that I wanted to go into Web Design
	until my sophomore year in high school. I love Full Sail University and am so happy to attend this awesome school.</p>


	<!-- Blog, Components -->

	<!-- Component 1-->
<div class="Comp1">
	<h2>Component 1: Header Navigation Bar</h2>
	<img src="components/1/header.png" alt="Header"/>

	<h3>What I hope to learn</h3>
	I hope to learn how to make my navigation bar position where and how I want it to go. Positioning, sizing, floating, and in-line block are the main parts
	of creating this, which are things I struggle with so I know it will be a challenge.

	<h3>How I feel this relates to what I have learned</h3>
	Well, I know that a navigation is easy access to the other main components of the website (Contacts, Information, or a gallery). The navigation is
	one of the nost important parts of the web page to me, because it is the first thing you see other than the logo. I have also learned that there
	are many different styles of the navigation. I will be using a simple one, but they all accomplish the same thing; allowing the user to navigate quickly and easly.

	<!-- Component 2-->
<div class="Comp2">
	<h2>Component 2: Services</h2>
	<img src="components/2/What we do.png" alt="About Us"/>

	<h3>What I hope to learn</h3>
	I hope to learn how to better use inline and float. I know that this will be my main objective for most of these
	components, because it is one of those things that I just don't get. I hope to be able to position the icons
	where they belong, as well as line up the text "in-line" below.

	<h3>How I feel this relates to what I've learned</h3>
	I feel this relates to the page that I created in one of my other classes. We were to look at the picture and recreate it
	through code and I had such a hard time creating the "About us" due to inline and Float, so hopefully this time I will be able
	to pick it up.
</div>

	<!-- Component 3-->
<div class="Comp3">
	<h2>Component 3: Our Creators</h2>
	<img src="components/3/Our Creators.png" alt="Our Creators"/>

	<h1>What I hope to learn</h1>
	This component is similar to the last. I hope to be able to create this and feel confident that I have done it correctly, but also know
	what I how to do it before drawing up any code.

	<h1>How I feel this relates to what I have learned</h1>
	I feel that this relates to many of the issues that I have when it comes to coding. Creating a section that shows "Our creators"
	allows the user to get a feel of who created this page and all about who they are. I like seeing these things on websites because it's interesting
	to see other developers background.
</div>

	<!-- Component 4-->
<div class="Comp4">
	<h2>Component 4: Testimonials</h2>
	<img src="components/4/Testimonial Pagination.png" alt="Testimonial"/>

	<h1>What I plan to learn</h1>
	I plan to learn how to align my arrows, images, and text in there correct places. I know that I will still use Float and inline tags.
	I really love to see testimonials on a website because it really sends a good message to the users or potential buyers.

	<h1>How I fee this relates to what I've learned</h1>
	This relates to a few things that I've learned, but not many. I have never created a news feed or testimonial section before. I have
	some experience with making image slide shows so it could be same.
</div>

	<!-- Component 5-->
<div class="Comp5">
	<h2>Component 5: Footer</h2>
	<img src="components/5/Footer.png" alt="Footer"/>

	<h1>What I plan to learn</h1>
	I plan on learning how to place the social media icons where they are inline, as well as adding a "back to top" arrow. I love
	footers and I really feel like they bring the page together with all of the information that most users look for in order to
	contact your company.

	<h1>How I feel this relates to what I've learned</h1>
	I feel that this relates to what I have done before. I really think my footer and header are the best things that I know how to do.
