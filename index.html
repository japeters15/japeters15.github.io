	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> My name is Janay Peters and I currently live in Atlanta,Ga. I was born in Mobile,Al and have lived in Georgia for 8 years now.
	I love to play tennis and dance; I've had a love for technology my whole life, but didn't know that I wanted to go into Web Design
	until my sophomore year in high school. I love Full Sail University and am so happy to attend this awesome school.</p>

	<h2>Component 1: Header Navigation Bar</h2>

	<h3>What I hope to learn</h3>
	I hope to learn how to make my navigation bar position where and how I want it to go. Positioning, sizing, floating, and in-line block are the main parts
	of creating this, which are things I struggle with so I know it will be a challenge.

	<h3>How I feel this relates to what I have learned</h3>
	Well, I know that a navigation is easy access to the other main components of the website (Contacts, Information, or a gallery). The navigation is
	one of the nost important parts of the web page to me, because it is the first thing you see other than the logo. I have also learned that there
	are many different styles of the navigation. I will be using a simple one, but they all accomplish the same thing; allowing the user to navigate quickly and easly.
