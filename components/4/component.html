	<h1>What I plan to learn</h1>
	I plan to learn how to align my arrows, images, and text in there correct places. I know that I will still use Float and inline tags.
	I really love to see testimonials on a website because it really sends a good message to the users or potential buyers.

	<h1>How I fee this relates to what I've learned</h1>
	This relates to a few things that I've learned, but not many. I have never created a news feed or testimonial section before. I have
	some experience with making image slide shows so it could be same.
