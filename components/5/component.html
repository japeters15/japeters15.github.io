	<h1>What I plan to learn</h1>
	I plan on learning how to place the social media icons where they are inline, as well as adding a "back to top" arrow. I love
	footers and I really feel like they bring the page together with all of the information that most users look for in order to
	contact your company.

	<h1>How I feel this relates to what I've learned</h1>
	I feel that this relates to what I have done before. I really think my footer and header are the best things that I know how to do.
